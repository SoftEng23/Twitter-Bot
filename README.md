You need a developer account on Twitter to plug in your own API tokens
You'll need to install python 
Before your bot will run you need to run the command "pip3 install -U git+https://github.com/tweepy/tweepy.git@2efe385fc69385b57733f747ee62e6be12a1338b"
Then run "pip install numpy --user"
Now you can run the helloworld.py file from your command line/command prompt by typing "python helloworld.py" or "python3 helloworld.py" on a Mac and your bot should begin running.
On a Mac you cd into the folder and type "python3 helloworld.py" to run the bot but on Windows you type "python helloworld.py"
