You need a developer account on Twitter to plug in your own API tokens
You'll need to install python 
Before your bot will run you need to run the command: pip3 install -U git+https://github.com/tweepy/tweepy.git@2efe385fc69385b57733f747ee62e6be12a1338b
Then run pip install numpy --user
Now you can type python helloworld.py and your bot should begin running.
Run the helloworld.py from your command line/command prompt
On a Mac you cd into the folder and type "python3 helloworld.py" to run the bot but on Windows you type "python helloworld.py"
